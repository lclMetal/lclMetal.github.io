  <h1>Launch-A-Sloth</h1>
  <p>
    Launch-A-Sloth is a game made for JAMK's Game Development Module. It is a physics puzzle game where the player has to use a cannon to launch a sloth called Thud upwards so he can eventually reach his home at the top of the mountain, from where he fell. The player has to bounce Thud around the walls of the levels in order to reach the level goal. There's only a limited amount of bounces available for each level, and if Thud doesn't reach the goal before running out of bounces, the player will have to try again with a different launch configuration.
  </p>
  <p>
    In each level, there's 2 objects the player can collect. The star is the level goal, which the player has to reach in order to progress to the next level. The leaf is an optional challenge item the player can collect to get a better rating on the level.
  </p>
    When the player reaches the goal they will be given a 1-3 star rating based on the following factors:
  <p>
  <ul>
    <li>1 star for beating the level</li>
    <li>+1 star for beating the level with &lt; 50% of the given bounces used</li>
    <li>+1 star for collecting the leaf</li>
  </ul>
  </p>
  <h2>Controls</h2>
  <p>
    Being a mobile game, the game can be played by using the mouse as a replacement of the touch input. There's also a couple of keybinds added to make playing more enjoyable in this version.
  </p>
  <p><strong>To select the angle</strong> you want to launch Thud at, click on Thud and while holding the left mouse button down, move the cursor towards where you want to aim.</p>
  <p><strong>To select the power</strong> you want to launch Thud with, click and hold anywhere above the cannon and slide the cursor up to increase power and down to decrease power.</p>
  <p><strong>To launch Thud</strong>, click on the base of the cannon or press <code>space</code>.</p>
  <p><strong>If Thud stops near the goal you can crawl</strong> towards it by clicking and holding on the right or left side of the screen to crawl to the corresponding direction.</p>
  <p><strong>To restart</strong> if you notice things aren't going to work out and don't want to wait for the lose screen, you can either click on the "<" button or press <code>R</code>.</p>
  <p><strong>To see the level goal</strong> in larger levels, click and hold the right mouse button. This functionality is still experimental.</p>
  <h2>A note about this version of the game</h2>
  <p>
    The game's intended target platform is Android, but this WebGL build is fully playable too. There's only a small caveat with this version compared to the Android version. In the Android version of the game there is a dynamic music feature, meaning that when the player launches Thud from the cannon, the music transitions to a faster version of the theme song. This functionality was implemented using a part of Unity's audio library that isn't supported on the WebGL platform, which has numerous limits on the audio side of things.
